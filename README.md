# Phase-3-Project

## Project Overview
This project examines a dataset from SyriaTel, a telecommunications company with the aim of using classification prediction modeling, to predict the likelihood of a customer ceasing to do business with the company within a given period. This is referred to as **Churn** in the telco industry.Acquiring new customers involves huge marketing costs, that include huge advertising budgets and commissions to sales agents. It therefore becomes imperative to retain those customers once they are acquired. It is the motivation of every telco company to understand the features or characteristics of a customer who is likely to 'churn'. With this understanding, the company can get ahead of the problem, and develop initiatives that target these specific customers , to discourage them from ceasing doing business with the company.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience
SyriaTel is intentional about reducing the high cost of churn. With this Model, their Data Analtics, Marketing and Revenue Assurance departments will be able to:-
+ Identify the customer characteristics (features) that have the most impact on churn.
+ Use the best model identified from the modeling iterative process test future customers' data in order to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the network.
+ Develop proactive retention strategies specifically targeted to 'at risk' customers to discourage them from leaving the network.
